# Oracle RAC Database on Container

Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) is an option to the award-winning Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. Oracle RAC is a cluster database with a shared cache architecture that overcomes the limitations of traditional shared-nothing and shared-disk approaches to provide highly scalable and available database solutions for all business applications. Oracle RAC uses Oracle Clusterware as a portable cluster software that allows clustering of independent servers so that they cooperate as a single system and Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) to provide simplified storage management that is consistent across all servers and storage platforms. Oracle Clusterware and Oracle ASM are part of the Oracle Grid Infrastructure, which bundles both solutions in an easy to deploy software package.

For more information on Oracle RAC Database 21c refer to the [Oracle Database documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/en/database/).

## How to build and run

This project offers sample container files for Oracle Grid Infrastructure and Oracle Real Application Clusters:
 * Oracle Database 21c Oracle Grid Infrastructure (21.3) for Linux x86-64
 * Oracle Database 21c (21.3) for Linux x86-64

IMPORTANT: To access the Oracle RAC DB on your network either use the Docker MACVLAN driver or use Oracle Connection Manager. To Run Oracle RAC containers on Multi-Host, you must use the Docker MACVLAN driver and your network must be reachable on all the nodes for Oracle RAC containers.

## Section 1: Prerequisites for Oracle RAC on Containers

**IMPORTANT:** You must make the changes specified in this section (customized for your environment) before you proceed to the next section.

You must install and configure [Oracle Container Runtime for Docker](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E87205/html/index.html) on Oracle Linux 7 to run Oracle RAC on Docker. Each container that you will deploy as part of your cluster must satisfy the minimum hardware requirements of the Oracle RAC and GI software. An Oracle Oracle RAC database is a shared everything database.

All data files, control files, redo log files, and the server parameter file (`SPFILE`) used by the Oracle RAC database must reside on shared storage that is accessible by all the Oracle Oracle RAC database instances.

You must provide block devices shared across the hosts.  If you don't have shared block storage, you can use an NFS volume.

Refer Oracle Database 21c Release documentation [Oracle Grid Infrastructure Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/cwlin/index.html) and allocate the following resource as per the Oracle documentation.

1. You must configure the following addresses manually in your DNS.
   * Public IP address for each container
   * Private IP address for each container
   * Virtual IP address for each container
   * Three single client access name (SCAN) addresses for the cluster.
2. If you are planning to use block devices for shared storage, allocate block devices for Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR)/voting and database files.
3. If you are planning to use NFS storage for OCR/Voting and database files, configure NFS storage and export at least one NFS mount. For testing purposes only, use the Oracle rac-storage-server image to deploy a docker container providing NFS-based sharable storage. This applies also to domain name server (DNS) server.
4. If you are planning to use DNSServer container for SCAN, IPs, VIPs resolution, configure DNSServer. For testing purposes only, use the Oracle rac-dns-server image to deploy a docker container providing DNS resolutions.
5. Verify you have enough memory and CPU resources available for all containers. Each container for Oracle RAC requires 8GB memory and 16GB swap.
6. For Oracle RAC, you must set the following parameters at the host level in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
fs.file-max = 6815744
net.core.rmem_max = 4194304
net.core.rmem_default = 262144
net.core.wmem_max = 1048576
net.core.wmem_default = 262144
net.core.rmem_default = 262144
```

 * Execute the following once the file is modified.

  ```
  # sysctl -a
  # sysctl -p
  ```

7. You need to plan your private and public network for containers before you start the installation. You can create a network bridge on every host so containers running within that host can communicate with each other.  For example, create `rac_pub1_nw` for the public network (`172.16.1.0/24`) and `rac_priv1_nw` (`192.168.17.0/24`) for a private network. You can use any network subnet for testing however in this document we reference the public network on `172.16.1.0/24` and the private network on `192.168.17.0/24`.

```
# docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.16.1.0/24 rac_pub1_nw
# docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.17.0/24 rac_priv1_nw
```

 * You must run Oracle RAC on Docker on multi-host using the [Docker MACVLAN Driver](https://docs.docker.com/network/macvlan/). To create a network bridge using MACVLAN docker driver using the following commands:

  ```
  # docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=172.16.1.0/24 --gateway=172.16.1.1 -o parent=eth0 rac_pub1_nw
  # docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.17.0/24 --gateway=192.168.17.1 -o parent=eth1 rac_priv1_nw
  ```

8.  Oracle RAC needs to run certain processes in real-time mode. To run processes inside a container in real-time mode, you need to make changes to the Docker configuration files. For details, refer to the [`dockerd` documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#examples). and  update the `OPTIONS` value in `/etc/sysconfig/docker` to following:

```
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --cpu-rt-runtime=950000'
```

 * Once you have edited the `/etc/sysconfig/docker`, execute following commands:

  ```
  # systemctl daemon-reload
  # systemctl stop docker
  # systemctl start docker
  ```

9. Verify you have enough memory and cpu resources available for container. For details, refer to [Oracle 21c Grid Infrastructure Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/cwlin/index.html)

10. To resolve VIPs and SCAN IPs, we are using a dummy DNS container in this guide. Before proceeding to the next step, create a [DNS server container](../OracleDNSServer/README.md). If you have a pre-configured DNS server in your environment, you can replace `-e DNS_SERVERS=172.16.1.25`, `--dns=172.16.1.25`, `-e DOMAIN=example.com`  and `--dns-search=example.com` parameters in **Section 2: Building Oracle RAC Database Docker Install Images** with the `DOMAIN_NAME' and 'DNS_SERVER' based on your environment.
 
11. The Oracle RAC dockerfiles, do not contain any Oracle Software Binaries. Download the following software from the [Oracle Technology Network](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html) and stage them under dockerfiles/<version> folder.

    Oracle Database 21c Grid Infrastructure (21.3) for Linux x86-64
    Oracle Database 21c (21.3) for Linux x86-64

### Notes
* If the docker bridge network is not available outside your host, you can use the Oracle Connection Manager (CMAN) image to access the Oracle RAC Database from outside the host.
* To understand the Oracle RAC on Docker setup in detail, you can refer [Best Practices for Deploying Oracle RAC on Docker](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/clustering/rac-ondocker-bp-wp-5458685.pdf) white paper published on OTN.

## Section 2: Building Oracle RAC Database Container Images

**IMPORTANT :** This section assumes that you have gone through all the pre-requisites in Section 1 and executed all the steps based on your environment. Do not uncompress the binaries and patches.

To assist in building the images, you can use the [buildContainerImage.sh](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleDatabase/RAC/OracleRealApplicationClusters/dockerfiles/buildContainerImage.sh) script. See the following for instructions and usage.

```
./buildContainerImage.sh -v <Software Version>
#  e.g., ./buildContainerImage.sh -v 21.3.0
```

For detailed usage of the command, execute the following command:

```
#  ./buildContainerImage.sh -h
```

### Notes

* The resulting images will contain the Oracle Grid Infrastructure Binaries and Oracle RAC Database binaries.
* If you are behind a proxy, you need to set the http_proxy or https_proxy environment variable based on your environment before building the image.

## Section 3: Creating the Oracle GI and RAC Container

All containers will share a host file for name resolution.  The shared hostfile must be available to all containers. Create the shared host file (if it doesn't exist) at `/opt/containers/rac_host_file`:

For example:

```
# mkdir /opt/containers
# touch /opt/containers/rac_host_file
```

**Note:** Do not modify `/opt/containers/rac_host_file` from docker host. It will be managed from within the containers.

If you are using the Oracle Connection Manager for accessing the Oracle RAC Database from outside the host, you need to add the following variable in the container creation command.

```
-e CMAN_HOSTNAME=(CMAN_HOSTNAME) -e CMAN_IP=(CMAN_IP)
```

**Note:** You need to replace `CMAN_HOSTNAME` and `CMAN_IP` with the correct values based on your environment settings.

### Password management

Specify the secret volume for resetting grid/oracle and database password during node creation or node addition. It can be shared volume among all the containers

```
mkdir /opt/.secrets/
openssl rand -hex 64 -out /opt/.secrets/pwd.key
```

Edit the `/opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile` and seed the password for grid/oracle and database. It will be a common password for grid/oracle and database users. Execute the following command:

```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile -out /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile.enc -pass file:/opt/.secrets/pwd.key
rm -f /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile
chmod 400 /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile.enc
chmod 400 /opt/.secrets/pwd.key
```

### Notes

* If you want to specify different passwords for all the accounts, create 3 different files and encrypt them under /opt/.secrets and pass the file name to the container using the env variable. Env variables can be ORACLE_PWD_FILE for oracle user, GRID_PWD_FILE for grid user, and DB_PWD_FILE for the database password.
* if you want a common password oracle, grid, and db user, you can assign a password file name to COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE env variable.
* Once the RAC enviornment setup completed, user must change Oracle/Grid and DB passwords based on his enviornment.

### Deploying Oracle RAC on Container With Block Devices:

If you are using an NFS volume, skip to the section "Deploying Oracle RAC on Container with NFS Volume".

Make sure the ASM devices do not have any existing file system. To clear any other file system from the devices, use the following command:

```
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xvde  bs=8k count=100000
```

Repeat for each shared block device. In the preceding example, `/dev/xvde` is a shared Xen virtual block device.

Now create the Oracle RAC container using the image. For the details of environment variables, refer to section 5. You can use the following example to create a container:

```
# docker create -t -i \
  --hostname racnode1 \
  --volume /boot:/boot:ro \
  --volume /dev/shm \
  --tmpfs /dev/shm:rw,exec,size=4G \
  --volume /opt/containers/rac_host_file:/etc/hosts  \
  --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets:ro \
  --dns=172.16.1.25 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
  --device=/dev/xvde:/dev/asm_disk1  \
  --device=/dev/xvdf:/dev/asm_disk2 \
  --privileged=false  \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE \
  --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e DNS_SERVERS="172.16.1.25" \
  -e NODE_VIP=172.16.1.160 \
  -e VIP_HOSTNAME=racnode1-vip  \
  -e PRIV_IP=192.168.17.150 \
  -e PRIV_HOSTNAME=racnode1-priv \
  -e PUBLIC_IP=172.16.1.150 \
  -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=racnode1  \
  -e SCAN_NAME=racnode-scan \
  -e OP_TYPE=INSTALL \
  -e DOMAIN=example.com \
  -e ASM_DEVICE_LIST=/dev/asm_disk1,/dev/asm_disk2 \
  -e ASM_DISCOVERY_DIR=/dev \
  -e CMAN_HOSTNAME=racnode-cman1 \
  -e CMAN_IP=172.16.1.15 \
  -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
  -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
  --restart=always --tmpfs=/run -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  --cpu-rt-runtime=95000 --ulimit rtprio=99  \
  --name racnode1 \
  oracle/database-rac:21.3.0
```

**Note:** Change environment variables such as IPs, ASM_DEVICE_LIST, PWD_FILE, and PWD_KEY based on your env. Also, change the devices based on your env.

### Deploying Oracle RAC on Container  With Oralce RAC Storage Container

Now create the Oracle RAC container using the image. For the details of environment variables, refer to section 6. You can use the following example to create a container:

```
# docker create -t -i \
  --hostname racnode1 \
  --volume /boot:/boot:ro \
  --volume /dev/shm \
  --tmpfs /dev/shm:rw,exec,size=4G \
  --volume /opt/containers/rac_host_file:/etc/hosts  \
  --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets:ro \
  --dns=172.16.1.25 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
  --privileged=false \
  --volume racstorage:/oradata \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE \
  --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e DNS_SERVERS="172.16.1.25" \
  -e NODE_VIP=172.16.1.160  \
  -e VIP_HOSTNAME=racnode1-vip  \
  -e PRIV_IP=192.168.17.150  \
  -e PRIV_HOSTNAME=racnode1-priv \
  -e PUBLIC_IP=172.16.1.150 \
  -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=racnode1  \
  -e SCAN_NAME=racnode-scan \
  -e OP_TYPE=INSTALL \
  -e DOMAIN=example.com \
  -e ASM_DISCOVERY_DIR=/oradata \
  -e ASM_DEVICE_LIST=/oradata/asm_disk01.img,/oradata/asm_disk02.img,/oradata/asm_disk03.img,/oradata/asm_disk04.img,/oradata/asm_disk05.img  \
  -e CMAN_HOSTNAME=racnode-cman1 \
  -e CMAN_IP=172.16.1.15 \
  -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
  -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
  --restart=always \
  --tmpfs=/run -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  --cpu-rt-runtime=95000 \
  --ulimit rtprio=99  \
  --name racnode1 \
  oracle/database-rac:21.3.0
```

**Notes:**

* Change environment variables such as IPs, ASM_DEVICE_LIST, PWD_FILE, and PWD_KEY based on your env. Also, change the devices based on your env.
* You must have created the `racstorage` volume before the creation of the Oracle RAC Container. For details about the env variables, refer the section 6.

### Assign networks to Oracle RAC containers

You need to assign the Docker networks created in section 1 to containers.Eexecute the following commands:

```
# docker network disconnect bridge racnode1
# docker network connect rac_pub1_nw --ip 172.16.1.150 racnode1
# docker network connect rac_priv1_nw --ip 192.168.17.150  racnode1
```

### Start the first container
You need to start the container.Execute the following command:

```
# docker start racnode1
```

It can take at least 40 minutes or longer to create the first node of the cluster. To check the logs, use the following command from another terminal session:

```
# docker logs -f racnode1
```

You should see the database creation success message at the end:

```
####################################
ORACLE RAC DATABASE IS READY TO USE!
####################################
```
### Connect to the Oracle RAC container
To connect to the container execute the following command:

```
# docker exec -i -t racnode1 /bin/bash
```

If the install fails for any reason, log in to the container using the preceding command and check `/tmp/orod.log`. You can also review the Grid Infrastructure logs located at `$GRID_BASE/diag/crs` and check for failure logs. If the failure occurred during the database creation then check the database logs.

## Section 4: Adding a Oracle RAC Node using a container

Before proceeding to the next step, ensure Oracle Grid Infrastructure is running and the Oracle RAC Database is open as per instructions in section 3. Otherwise, the node addition process will fail.

### Password management
Specify the secret volume for resetting grid/oracle and database passwords during node creation or node addition. It can be shared volume among all the containers

```
mkdir /opt/.secrets/
openssl rand -hex 64 -out /opt/.secrets/pwd.key
```

Edit the `/opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile` and seed the password for grid/oracle and database. It will be a common password for grid/oracle and database user. Execute the following command:

```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile -out /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile.enc -pass file:/opt/.secrets/pwd.key
rm -f /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile
```

### Notes

* If you want to specify the different password for all the accounts, create 3 different files and encrypt them under /opt/.secrets and pass the file name to the container using the env variable. Env variables can be ORACLE_PWD_FILE for oracle user, GRID_PWD_FILE for grid user and DB_PWD_FILE for the database password.
* if you want a common password oracle, grid, and db user, you can assign a password file name to COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE env variable.

Reset the password on the existing Oracle RAC node for SSH setup between an existing node in the cluster and the new node. Password must be the same on all the nodes for grid and oracle users. Execute the following command on an existing node of the cluster.

```
docker exec -i -t -u root racnode1 /bin/bash
sh  /opt/scripts/startup/resetOSPassword.sh --help
sh /opt/scripts/startup/resetOSPassword.sh --op_type reset_grid_oracle --pwd_file common_os_pwdfile.enc --secret_volume /run/secrets --pwd_key_file pwd.key
```
**Note:** If you do not have a common secret volume among Oracle RAC containers, populate the password file with the same password that you have used on the new node, encrypt the file, and execute resetOSPassword.sh on the exiting node of the cluster.

### Deploying with Block Devices:

If you are using an NFS volume, skip to the section "Deploying with the Oracle RAC Storage Container".

To create additional nodes, use the following command:

```
# docker create -t -i \
  --hostname racnode2 \
  --volume /dev/shm \
  --tmpfs /dev/shm:rw,exec,size=4G  \
  --volume /boot:/boot:ro \
  --dns-search=example.com  \
  --volume /opt/containers/rac_host_file:/etc/hosts \
  --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets:ro \
  --dns=172.16.1.25 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
  --device=/dev/xvde:/dev/asm_disk1 \
  --device=/dev/zvdf:/dev/asm_disk2 \
  --privileged=false \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE \
  --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e DNS_SERVERS="172.16.1.25" \
  -e EXISTING_CLS_NODES=racnode1 \
  -e NODE_VIP=172.16.1.161  \
  -e VIP_HOSTNAME=racnode2-vip  \
  -e PRIV_IP=192.168.17.151  \
  -e PRIV_HOSTNAME=racnode2-priv \
  -e PUBLIC_IP=172.16.1.151  \
  -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=racnode2  \
  -e DOMAIN=example.com \
  -e SCAN_NAME=racnode-scan \
  -e ASM_DISCOVERY_DIR=/dev \
  -e ASM_DEVICE_LIST=/dev/asm_disk1,/dev/asm_disk2 \
  -e ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB \
  -e OP_TYPE=ADDNODE \
  -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
  -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
  --tmpfs=/run -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  --cpu-rt-runtime=95000 \
  --ulimit rtprio=99  \
  --restart=always \
  --name racnode2 \
  oracle/database-rac:21.3.0
```

For details of all environment variables and parameters, refer to section 6.

### Deploying Oracle RAC on Container with Oracle RAC Storage Container

If you are using physical block devices for shared storage, skip to "Assigning Network to additional Oracle RAC container"

Use the existing `racstorage:/oradata` volume when creating the additional container using the image.

For example:

```
# docker create -t -i \
  --hostname racnode2 \
  --volume /dev/shm \
  --tmpfs /dev/shm:rw,exec,size=4G  \
  --volume /boot:/boot:ro \
  --dns-search=example.com  \
  --volume /opt/containers/rac_host_file:/etc/hosts \
  --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets:ro \
  --dns=172.16.1.25 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
  --privileged=false \
  --volume racstorage:/oradata \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE \
  --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e DNS_SERVERS="172.16.1.25" \
  -e EXISTING_CLS_NODES=racnode1 \
  -e NODE_VIP=172.16.1.161  \
  -e VIP_HOSTNAME=racnode2-vip  \
  -e PRIV_IP=192.168.17.151  \
  -e PRIV_HOSTNAME=racnode2-priv \
  -e PUBLIC_IP=172.16.1.151  \
  -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=racnode2  \
  -e DOMAIN=example.com \
  -e SCAN_NAME=racnode-scan \
  -e ASM_DISCOVERY_DIR=/oradata \
  -e ASM_DEVICE_LIST=/oradata/asm_disk01.img,/oradata/asm_disk02.img,/oradata/asm_disk03.imgv,/oradata/asm_disk04.img,/oradata/asm_disk05.img \
  -e ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB \
  -e OP_TYPE=ADDNODE \
  -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
  -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
  --tmpfs=/run -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  --cpu-rt-runtime=95000 \
  --ulimit rtprio=99  \
  --restart=always \
  --name racnode2 \
  oracle/database-rac:21.3.0
```

**Notes:**
* You must have created **racstorage** volume before the creation of the Oracle RAC container.
* You can change env variables such as IPs and ORACLE_PWD based on your env. For details about the env variables, refer the section 6.

### Assign Network to additional Oracle RAC container

Assign Network to container

```
# docker network disconnect bridge racnode2
# docker network connect rac_pub1_nw --ip 172.16.1.151 racnode2
# docker network connect rac_priv1_nw --ip 192.168.17.151 racnode2
```

### Start Oracle RAC container

Start the container

```
# docker start racnode2
```

To check the DB logs, tail the logs using the following command:

```
# docker logs -f racnode2
```

You should see the database creation success message at the end.

```
####################################
ORACLE RAC DATABASE IS READY TO USE!
####################################
```

### Connect to the Oracle RAC container

To connect to the container execute the following command:

```
# docker exec -i -t racnode2 /bin/bash
```

If the node addition fails, log in to the container using the preceding command and review `/tmp/orod.log`. You can also review the Grid Infrastructure logs i.e. `$GRID_BASE/diag/crs` and check for failure logs. If the node creation has failed during the database creation process, then check DB logs.

## Section 5: Connecting to Oracle RAC Database

**IMPORTANT:** This section assumes that you have successfully created an Oracle RAC environment.

If you are using connection manager and exposed port 1521 on the host, connect from an external client using the following connection string:

```
system/<password>@//<docker_host>:1521/<ORACLE_SID>
```

If you are using the Docker MACVLAN driver and you have configured DNS appropriately, you can connect using the public scan listener directly from any external client using the following connection string:

```
system/<password>@//<scan_name>:1521/<ORACLE_SID>
```
